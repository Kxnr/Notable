# Notable
Note taking and manipulation tools

## Introduction

Notable is a collection of note taking and task management tools backed by commonmark flavored
Markdown files. It is intended to be simple to use and simple to replicate so that your notes stay
yours no matter what.

## Notable Format

Notable uses markdown files much as `vimwiki`, `obsidian`, and `markdown-oxide` do. This project
rests entirely on their shoulders (or possibly at their feet). Notes are organized into Notebooks
each of which are ordinary directories with plain markdown files.
